# Song-Genre-Classification
Classifying song genre using audio data

In this project, we explore the classification of music genres using a dataset
comprising songs from six distinct genres: Hip-Hop, Rock, Reggae, Blues, classical, metal. The dataset,
sourced from the GTZAN dataset, contains track information derived from
Echonest, now a part of Spotify. We use Python libraries such as pandas and
seaborn for data manipulation and visualization, respectively, to analyze
trends and factors pertinent to genre classification. We implement popular
algorithms including logistic regression, decision trees, and principal
component analysis (PCA) using the scikit-learn package to predict genre
classifications. Through extensive evaluation and comparison of model
performance, we ascertain the effectiveness of each algorithm in accurately
classifying songs into their respective genres. Our findings provide insights
into the feasibility and limitations of genre classification based solely on
track information, offering potential avenues for future research and
refinement of classification techniques.
